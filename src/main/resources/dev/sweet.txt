And I will stroll the merry way and jump the hedges first
And I will drink the clear, clean water for to quench my thirst
And I shall watch the ferry-boats, and they'll get high
On a bluer ocean against tomorrow's sky
And I will never grow so old again
And I will walk and talk in gardens all wet with rain
Oh, whoa-oh, sweet thing, this sweet thing
Eh-hey, yeah, sweet thing, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, my, my, my, my sweet thing
And I shall drive my chariot down your streets and cry
"Hey, it's me, I'm dynamite and I don't know why"
And you shall take me strongly in your arms again
And I will not remember that I even felt the pain
We shall walk and talk in gardens all misty wet
All misty wet with rain, down
And I will never, never, never grow so old again
Oh, whoa-oh, this sweet thing
Oh, whoa-oh, you sweet thing, sweet thing
My, my, my, my-my, my, my, my
And I will raise my hand up into the nighttime sky
And count the stars that's shining in your eye
And just to dig it all and not to wonder, that's just fine
And I'll be satisfied not to read in between the lines
And I will walk and talk in gardens, all wet with rain
And I will never, ever, ever, ever grow so old again
Oh, whoa-oh, sweet thing
Oh, whoa-oh, whoa, sugar baby
Oh, whoa-oh, sweet thing
Sugar baby
Sugar baby, sugar baby
What a champagne eyes
And your saint-like smile
